# 1.9-SSG-MultiInstances

This is a macro for 1.9 ssg speedruning.
Maybe it can be used in other(previous 1.14)versions , you can try.
It can filter the spawn point of the seed(SpawnJuicer).
It uses Atum's hotkey to reset worlds to prevent the screen issue.

Use the latest Atum,Tabfocus.
Recommend StandardSettings and SleepBackground.
