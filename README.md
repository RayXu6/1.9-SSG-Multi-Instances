# 1.9-SSG-MultiInstances

This is a macro for 1.9 ssg speedruning.      
Maybe it can be used in other(previous 1.14)versions , you can try.      
It can filter the spawn point of the seed(SpawnJuicer).      
It uses Atum's hotkey to reset worlds to prevent the screen issue.      

It is a fork of 1.8 ssgjuice which is forked from spawnjuicer.    
Use the latest Atum,Tabfocus.      
DO NOT CHANGE THE ATUM'S "CREATE NEW WORLD" HOTKEY F6         
Recommend StandardSettings and SleepBackground.
